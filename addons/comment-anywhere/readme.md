# Comment anywhere

Early WIP.

Idea is to make a system that can comment at any location/URL. Part of/related to
the gpgshare idea which would share comments.

## TODO

* Way of placing notes above/below/right/left, making sure that works for people.
* Styling the stuff.(configurable, good defaults)
* Actually communicating to get comments.
* Test (much)more, on websites and browsers in the wild.

## Done

* Find locations: scratched this goal for now. Users can use links inside html
  manually though.

* Way of placing notes near the article: currently splits some space off the side.
  However if the web page doesnt scale well in that way, or if space is already at
  premium, that needs to be better.
